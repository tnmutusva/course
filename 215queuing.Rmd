## Queueing Models

A queuing model is characterized by:


1. The arrival process of customers.
Usually we assume that the interarrival times are independent and have a common distri- bution. In many practical situations customers arrive according to a Poisson stream (i.e. exponential interarrival times). Customers may arrive one by one, or in batches. An ex- ample of batch arrivals is the customs office at the border where travel documents of bus passengers have to be checked.
2. The behaviour of customers. Customers may be patient and willing to wait (for a long time). Or customers may be impatient and leave after a while. For example, in call centers,customers will hang up when they have to wait too long before an operator is available, and they possibly try again after a while.
