Assessment for the courses shall be based on continuous assessment as well as Institute examinations. Continuous assessment will contribute 25% of the overall assessment mark of that course. Continuous assessment dates are as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
T1<- read_excel("T1.xlsx")
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(T1) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive",position = "center", full_width = T)) %>%
footnote( symbol = c("Only students who attend tutorials will be allowed to write tests.")) %>%
 row_spec(1:2,bold=T,  background = "green")%>%
row_spec(3:6,bold=T,  background = "yellow")
```
